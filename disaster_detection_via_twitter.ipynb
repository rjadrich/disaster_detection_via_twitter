    "---\n",
    "**Goal:** Create a predictive model to classify a tweet as pertaining to a disaster event or not, *solely* based on the tweet text.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data:** 10,876 classified tweet entries in the \"Disasters on Social Media\" data set from CrowdFlower at http://www.crowdflower.com/data-for-everyone. Some examples of disasters include structural collapses, wildfires and terrorist attacks. However, this dataset also encompases more \"minor\" events such as car accidents, etc. These were compiled by searching for tweets with disaster related keywords (i.e., hijacking, hurricane, explosion) and then they were classified as \"Relevant\", \"Not Relevant\" or \"Can't Decide\" with \"Relevant\" indicating a disaster.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Auxillary data:** Pretrained \"Google News\" datset for word2vec at https://code.google.com/archive/p/word2vec/. This will be used to artificially boost the vocabulary of the model which is somewhat limited due to the smaller size of the tweet data set.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Machine learning tools** \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK)** - For initial preprocessing and tokenization of tweets using the nltk.tokenize package.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **GENSIM** - For seemless transformation from a high dimensional \"bag of words\" (BOW) feature space to a lower dimensional \"topic\" space (each topic expresses discovered relations amongst the words in the Tweet data set using Latent Semantic Indexing or LSI).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Scikit-Learn** - For trivial implementation the final Logistic Regression model which predicts \"disaster\" or \"not disaster\" based on each Tweets \"topic\" representation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Using the model**: Clone the entire git repository to your local machine and install any packages not already installed (likely NLTK and GENSIM). All data used by the notebook is included in the repository so, in principle, the notebook should be ready to deploy and improve upon. Please let me know of any major improvements!   :) "
